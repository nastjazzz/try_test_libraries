This repository was created to try some testing libraries for different test.

Here I tried different types of tests like unit tests, intergation tests, e2e tests.

Unit test are the most common type of test. They should cover the functions, helpers and methods of classes. They are small tests, but they should cover most of the system.

Intergration test are tests that include several modules linked to each other.

E2E test are tests that work with real data, run in a real browser. These tests should not be many and they cover basic functionality
